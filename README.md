# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

The app takes in a url typed by a user in a browser interface, and generates a random string of 6 characters. That 6 character string is set as a shorter version of the url typed by the user. That shorter url is displayed as a link that redirects the user to the corresponding url. A user is expected to register and login in order to use the features provided by this app.
